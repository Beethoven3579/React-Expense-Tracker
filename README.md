## Project Summary
This was an extremely fun and challenging app to build at this stage in my programming journey. This was the first 
application I have ever built using the React framework. This was also the first app that I built using Bootstrap. 
This was a welcome relief of some of the challenges of making a Mobile-Responsive application! I hope to add some features in the future such as a budget indicator, currency types with icons, and catagories that track percentages of Food, Utilities, Entertainment etc.
